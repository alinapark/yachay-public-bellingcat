# Project name: Yachay AI, Telegram Bot

## Team Members
[Yachay AI team](https://www.yachay.ai/)

## Tool Description
We see an untapped potential in the development of OSINT tools for text-based geolocation. Hours of researchers' work to find, clean and process images/texts to identify a person's location could have been reduced to seconds with automated text analysis. 

**As NLP developers, we decided to tackle this challenge by creating an environment:**
1. For investigators to communicate with the models in the simplest way possible 
2. For other developers to contribute to our project and help us improve the models

This project is a new take on the [models](https://github.com/1712n/yachay-public/tree/master/conf_geotagging_model) previously released by Yachay AI: we are swapping the existing infrastructure with a ByT5 model, and setting up a simple User Interface for people to see it in action.

Now, one can simply text our bot on telegram and receive an analysis - life doesn't get easier than that ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Œ

## Installation
**There is no need to install anything to use this project! Simply text our [telegram bot](https://t.me/YachayAi_Bot) at [@YachayAi_Bot](https://t.me/YachayAi_Bot)**

In case you want to create your own version of the tool, the data sets can be found in the Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1thkE-hgT3sDtZqILZH17Hyayy0hkk_jh/view?usp=share_link) and [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P2QUGFBKaqdpZ4xAHmJMe2I57I94MJyO?usp=sharing).


#### Dependencies:
- pytorch == 1.7.1
- numpy == 1.19.2
- scikit-learn == 0.22.2
- tqdm == 4.62.3
- pandas == 1.0.3

The new, improved infrastructure created for this hackathon:

- `ByT5_model.py` - model implementation
- `train_model.py` - training code
- `utils.py` - inference code

Heads Up: this project is a demo for the hackathon. More updates on the models will be in the [main repository](https://github.com/1712n/yachay-public/tree/master/conf_geotagging_model):)

## Usage

2. The bot introduces itself:)

3. Now send a text - anything under 300 characters would work. Give the bot a couple of moments to reply

5. Done âœ… - easy ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”


## Additional Information



The Telegram bot serves as a demo of the models' potential - it's a work-in-progress and exists for demonstration purposes only. 

Still, we are providing all the [data and infrastructure code](https://github.com/1712n/yachay-public/tree/master/conf_geotagging_model) to make sure other developers can contribute:)
